Conclusions
1. Bitcoin price prediction using machine learning models remains a challenging task due to the high volatility and unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency markets.

2. The logistic regression and random forest classification models demonstrated modest predictive capabilities, correctly classifying around 55% of the instances in the test set. However, their performance in predicting price decreases (class -1) was poor, with low precision, recall, and F1-scores.

3. Time series analysis techniques, such as simple moving averages (SMA) and the ARIMA model, can capture the overall trend and patterns in Bitcoin prices, but may struggle with accurately predicting sharp fluctuations or sudden price movements.

4. The ARIMA (2, 1, 0) model achieved a reasonably good mean squared error (MSE) of 2.394227%, indicating a reasonable fit for forecasting Bitcoin prices, given the asset's volatility.

5. Feature engineering and the selection of relevant technical indicators played a crucial role in the performance of the machine learning models, as evidenced by the correlation analysis and feature importance scores.

6. Continuous monitoring and updating of the models with the latest data is necessary to maintain accurate predictions, as the cryptocurrency market is highly dynamic and influenced by various external factors.

7. Future work could explore ensemble models, incorporating additional data sources (e.g., sentiment analysis, news, economic indicators), and advanced deep learning techniques to improve the predictive accuracy of Bitcoin price movements.

In summary, our project highlights the challenges and potential approaches for Bitcoin price prediction, while also acknowledging the limitations and the need for continued research and model refinement in this rapidly evolving domain.
